## The challenge

This is a challenge from [Fontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/home).

The challenge was to build out the landing page and get it looking as close to the design that was given as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

All the media assets were provided for this challenge but the planning of the design and what tools and frameworks I used was left to me. This was created using pure HTML and CSS only.

Your challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

This challenge focuses mostly on HTML & CSS. There's a tiny bit of JS included for the mobile navigation toggle. But you could also choose to do this without JS!

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
